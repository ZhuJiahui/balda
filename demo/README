This demo will extract some topics from Reuters corpus. These are some finance/economy news.

To see this running, please download this file first:

http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/reuters21578/reuters21578.tar.gz

and place it into some directory (and keep the file zipped).

Then from the location of the demo.jar file execute this command

java -jar demo.jar /PATH/TO/reuters21578.tar

The program will start parsing the reuters' source file; it will take a couple of minutes.

Then the sampler will start and it will take another few minutes to extract topics. As an output,
the sampler will print all 100 topics as a collections of tokens, along with their weights (probabilities)
so that most prominent terms show first.
